### Why Nebula?

#### 🎯 100% Tailored to You
Forget generic "beginner" or "advanced" tracks. Nebula analyzes your unique background—what you already know and what you need to skip—to generate a **custom curriculum** specific to your goals. No wasted time on concepts you've already mastered.

#### 🧠 The Mastery Engine
We don't just show you content; we ensure you own it. Nebula uses a sophisticated **Mastery Engine** driven by the **URAC Framework** (Understand, Retain, Apply, Connect). It tracks your "acquired competencies" in real-time, ensuring every new lesson builds strictly on a solid foundation.

#### 🔄 Dynamic Adaptation
Your learning path isn't set in stone. As you progress, Nebula adapts. If you breeze through a module, it accelerates. If you struggle, it provides deeper context and alternative explanations. It evolves as you evolve.
